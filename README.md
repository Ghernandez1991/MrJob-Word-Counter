# MrJob-Word-Counter

Using MrJob, create a word counter which breaks the paragraph into small incremental tasks which can be aggregated over a larger Hadoop cluster. This uses a small text file but could be scaled up for a large file too large to process on a single machine. 
Users will need to run the file in the command line and reference the text file.
